# Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on: 
- Scratch Radio App for mobile devices, so people can listen to a student-led radio station.
- Dan Richards App for mobile devices, this an app which people can enjoy listening to Dan Richards' jingle. If your lucky enough to meet him, he will expect the app.
- Logic-Client which is a minecraft client which is a custom client to LogicFlameMC and the plugin.
- LogicFlame plugin for minecraft Bukkit servers and Bungee. (An upgraded version of essentials which contains more customisation and multiple plugins in one).  Plugins such as AntiDisconnectSpam and ScreenShare.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Dart
- Java
- JS
- PHP - More in depth
