ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- Logic-Client which is a minecraft client which is a custom client to LogicFlameMC and the plugin.
- LogicFlame plugin for minecraft Bukkit servers and Bungee. (An upgraded version of essentials which contains more customisation and multiple plugins in one).  Plugins such as AntiDisconnectSpam and ScreenShare.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Java
- JS
- PHP - More in depth
